voltGraph is a program written in Python 3.8 using PyQt5 and the PyQtGraph library to read input from an
analog to digital converter (ADC), using an Arduino, and both graph, and store the data in real time. This is a useful
program for reading older scientific instruments that may have broken displays, or substandard readouts.

The voltageEmulator.py file is a random number generator to emulate a voltage readout for testing purposes. It is not
necessary for running the program with an instrument, but is helpful for testing.
